# 1367 agency

This repo contains all the packages for the 1367 agency.

## Getting started

### Initial setup

This repo is managed using `turborepo` - a monorepository management tool.

### Installing dependencies

Running `npm install` in the root of this project will install the dependencies for all packages and apps. You should make a habit of calling this whenever pulling a remote branch, including `main` to ensure any changes are reflected in the underlying `node_modules` folder.
